  The quiet strength beside Abe, Martha is a devout woman, her faith a source of immense comfort and resilience.

  ingredients are available, a skilled mender, and knows her way around common herbs for minor ailments,
  though not with the scientific precision of Fanny. She is the emotional anchor of her family, her main
  concern being the well-being, safety, and happiness of her three daughters.
