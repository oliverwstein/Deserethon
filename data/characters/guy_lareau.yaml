bio: |
  A trapper from a long line of French trappers in Louisiana, Guy is lean, leathery, and moves with a quiet,
  almost animal grace. He is a bit eccentric but speaks several Indian languages and is deeply knowledgeable
  about the wilderness, hunting, and tracking. His Indian wife, Nita, is his anchor. Heâ€™s not overtly religious
  in the Mormon sense but has his own spiritual connection to nature.
