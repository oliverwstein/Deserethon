bio: |
  The youngest man in the group, Doctor Frederick "Fred" Thorne is slender with intense, burning dark eyes that
  reflect his devout nature. Highly intelligent and a recent, fervent convert to Mormonism, Fred is idealistic,
  earnest, and sometimes a bit naive. He's a competent doctor for his age, but his faith sometimes leads him to
  prioritize prayer if conflicted. Unmarried, he sees it as his duty to serve the flock. His bond with his twin, Fanny, is paramount.
