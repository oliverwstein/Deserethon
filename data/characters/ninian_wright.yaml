bio: |
  Still showing some of the gangliness of youth but with hints of the beauty she's growing into, Ninian has big,
  curious hazel eyes and a cloud of light brown, flyaway hair. Quieter than her sister Molly, she is more observant
  and also unhappy about being dragged West, though she expresses it less overtly. She has a surprising practical
  streak and a secret love for baking, a skill from her Philadelphia childhood. Sheâ€™s imaginative and a little dreamy.
