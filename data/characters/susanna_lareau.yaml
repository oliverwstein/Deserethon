bio: |
  The older Lareau daughter, Susanna is a striking blend of her parents, with her mother's dark complexion and
  high cheekbones, possibly her father's lighter eye color, and a voluptuous, curvy figure she carries with
  unselfconscious, earthy grace. Sensual, artistic, and deeply connected to the earth, she has a gift for
  ceramics, able to find and work clay into beautiful and practical forms.
