bio: |
  Looking her age, tired from years of hard work, raising four children, and the rigors of the trail, Eliza
  nevertheless has a resilient spirit in her eyes. The matriarch of the Horn family, she is pragmatic,
  no-nonsense, and deeply loves her children. She defers to Daniel in public but likely wields considerable
  influence in private. Her hands are work-worn, and her movements economical and practiced.
