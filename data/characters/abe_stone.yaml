bio: |
  A man of the earth, Abe is practical, stoic, and deeply committed to his family and his faith, in that order.
  He's seen hardship before and believes in honest toil. He plans to grow grain, primarily wheat and barley,
  seeing them as the staples for bread and sustenance for the community. His dream for Deseret was simple:
  good land, a peaceful community to raise his daughters right. He's not a great talker but a steady worker,
  his hands gnarled like roots from years of farming. He respects strength, common sense, and proven results.
