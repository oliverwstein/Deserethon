bio: |
  More overtly pretty than Julia, Kate has a sprinkle of freckles across her nose and her mother's warmer brown eyes.
  She once had a livelier energy, though it's been subdued by the recent, tragic loss of her fianc√©, who was part
  of the main caravan group they were separated from. She's still a hard worker, good with animals, and has a
  knack for gardening. Resilient beneath her sorrow, she might be prone to moments of wistfulness or sharp frustration.
