bio: |
  Guy's wife, Nita, is beautiful in a strong, serene way, with features reflecting her Native heritage.
  Her dark, knowing eyes miss little, and her long black hair is often braided. Quiet, observant, and wise
  in the ways of nature and human nature, she is the bedrock of Guy's family. She is skilled in traditional
  Native crafts, hide tanning, and herbal remedies that differ from Fanny's European-based knowledge.
