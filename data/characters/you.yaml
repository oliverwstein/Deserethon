bio: |
  A brilliant young man, his mind was first sharpened by the rigors of philosophy in the esteemed halls of Eastern academia.
  However, the call of fortune and adventure proved too strong, luring him to the raw, untamed lands of Texas.
  There, his path intertwined with that of Sam Houston, fighting with distinction. When the Mexican-American War
  erupted, Elias's inherent leadership and tactical acumen saw him rise to the rank of officer, a position he
  held with honor. It was amidst the smoke and chaos of war that he encountered a fervent Mormon missionary,
  whose words of faith and a promised land resonated deep within his soul, offering a new purpose.
  With the war's conclusion, Elias set his sights West, a recent but earnest convert, carrying the bearing of a commander,
  the keen intellect of a scholar, and the unyielding resilience forged in battle. He is a man accustomed to making
  hard choices, and inspiring others to follow.
