bio: |
  A widower, Caleb's profound grief was the catalyst for his fervent, almost fanatical, conversion to Mormonism.
  He sold his successful hotel in Philadelphia, bought a flock of fifteen sheep, and headed West, seeing himself
  as a literal shepherd to his small flock. Lean and weathered, with startlingly intense blue eyes, he can be
  preachy and judgmental but is also genuinely kind beneath his religious zeal. His faith is his guiding light.
