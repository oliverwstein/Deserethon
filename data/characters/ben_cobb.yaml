bio: |
  Wiry and sun-browned, Ben Cobb has a restless energy about him. His sharp, assessing eyes and quick, sometimes
  cynical, grin hint at a more worldly nature. He's a capable farmer, focused on corn, claiming it's primarily for
  animal feed, though the glint in his eye suggests he knows it could be distilled into alcohol if circumstances
  (and community rules) allowed. He's frustrated by their childlessness and can be sharp-tongued or prone to
  brooding. He came West for a fresh start and perhaps a bit more freedom than he found back East.
