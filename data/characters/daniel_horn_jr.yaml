bio: |
  Strikingly mature for his age, Daniel Jr. "Dan Jr." is tall and already showing his father's sturdy build,
  though he has his mother's kinder eyes. Responsible and hardworking, he idolizes his father and is eager to
  learn trades from both him and Emmett, the farrier. He’s good with the cows and surprisingly adept with tools.
  He’s protective of his sisters and has a natural, youthful bond with Ninian Wright.
