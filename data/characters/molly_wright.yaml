bio: |
  Tall and willowy, Molly carries an air of bored sophistication she hasn't quite managed to shed from her
  upbringing in Philadelphia. Her dark hair is usually styled with more care than the other young women,
  a subtle rebellion. Smart, articulate, and with expressive, intelligent brown eyes, she deeply misses
  city society and finds frontier life, along with her father's religious fervor, rather oppressive.
  She's not openly rebellious but possesses a sharp tongue and a cynical wit.
