bio: |
  Strikingly lovely, Fanny possesses a mind every bit as keen and intense as her twin brother Fred's. Her dark eyes,
  however, are filled with sharp intelligence, skepticism, and a spark of mischief. Proficient in herb lore,
  chemistry, and midwifery, she's often more practically effective than her brother. Less keen on Mormonism,
  finding its dogma stifling, her love for Fred is absolute; she came West solely because the notion of being
  separated was unthinkable. They lost their parents as teens and had to rely on each other.
